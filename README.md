# FineGraphics

## Introduction 

The FineGraphics is a standalone library that provides the basic API wrappers around OpenGL, such as textures, framebuffers, renderbuffers, shaders, including window handling (using GLFW) and basic 2D canvas rendering (using nanovg library). This library does not hold your hand, nor does it forces you to design your application in one specific way. For example, when using the GLRenderWindow class to create your window, it will not initialize any hidden variables (such as fonts, etc...). To do that, you will have to use specific classes and explicitly call the necessary methods. Some heavy OpenGL frameworks usually intiailize many things for you in the background, this FineGraphics is trying to do the opposite. When you create a window, only a window is created. If you create a 2D Canvas for rendering, only a canvas created. No hidden global state, except Core OpenGL extensions that are loaded only once on the window creation. This library is meant to be lightweight and to provide the necessary minimum to handle OpenGL the easy way.

This library also bundles all third party libraries statically. Meaning, you only have to link the `.lib`  file (or `.so` on Linux). No need to manually download the libraries (GLFW, FreeType2, etc.), and spend an entire weekend figuring out how to plug it all together, and going through outdated or complicated instructions for some libraries. You either download the pre-built FineGraphics from the GitHub releases, or build it manually (which is super easy), and you are good to go!

## Features

* OpenGL wrappers (GLTexture2D, GLTexture2DMS, GLTexture2DArray, GLTexture3D, GLShader, GLProgram, ...)
* OpenGL Core extensions loading (which are globally accessible)
* Window handling using GLFW (an abstract class is provided to include additional backends)
* Matrices: 3x3 and 4x4
* Vector algebra: 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors including Quaternion
* 2D Canvas using nanovg

## Dependencies

All dependencies listed here are already included as a git submodule and will be statically linked to the fineframework library. Therefore, no need to compile them manually, nor link them manually! Everything is automated via CMake.

* [freetype2](https://www.freetype.org/) - Used by NanoVG for font loading
* [glfw](https://www.glfw.org/) - Used as a primary backend (ffw::GLRenderWindow) for creating GL context and handling user input
* [libpng](https://github.com/glennrp/libpng) - Needed by FreeType2
* [nanovg](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) - Used as a 2D canvas rendering backend
* [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader.git) - Only used in examples
* [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib) - Needed by FreeType2

## TODO

* More examples, documentation, and tutorials
* More unit tests
* Vulkan (maybe)

## Quick example

Create a rendering window and draw a rectangle:

```cpp
#include <ffw/graphics.h>
#include <iostream>

class App : public ffw::GLRenderWindow {
public:
    App(const ffw::RenderWindowArgs& args):GLRenderWindow(args, nullptr) {
        canvas = ffw::GLCanvas(ffw::GLCanvas::Settings());
        glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    }
    ~App() {
    }
    void render() override {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        canvas.beginFrame(this->getSize());
        canvas.beginPath();
        canvas.roundedRect(
            ffw::Vec2f(10.0f, 10.0f), // pos
            ffw::Vec2f(100.0f, 50.0f), // size
            10.0f // roundness
        );
        canvas.fillColor(ffw::hsv(0.0f, 0.7f, 0.8f, 1.0f));
        canvas.fill();
        canvas.strokeWidth(10.0f);
        canvas.strokeColor(ffw::hsv(0.7f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f));
        canvas.stroke();
        canvas.endFrame();
    }
    void windowCloseEvent() override {
        this->shouldClose(true);
    }
private:
    ffw::GLCanvas canvas;
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    ffw::RenderWindowArgs args;
    args.size = ffw::Vec2i(400, 400);
    args.title = "Example";
    args.samples = 4;
    try {
        App app(args);
        while (app.shouldRender()) {
            app.renderFrame();
            app.poolEvents();
        }
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    } catch (std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
}
```

## Requirements

One of the following compilers:

* (Windows) Visual Studio 2013 32-bit or 64-bit
* (Windows) Visual Studio 2015 32-bit or 64-bit
* (Windows) Visual Studio 2017 32-bit or 64-bit
* (Windows) MinGW-w64 i686
* (Windows) MinGW-w64 x86_64
* (Linux) GCC 4.9 or newer
* (OSX) Clang 3.7 or newer

## Compiling

You can compile the FineGraphics from the source code (see below), or [use one of the automatically built releases from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/matusnovak/finegraphics/releases).

### Linux

Install this packages before compiling. These are needed for git, cmake, g++, OpenGL, and X11. 
When distributing an application linked with FineGraphics, these packages are not required for the users.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
```

Then, compile from the source code:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matusnovak/finegraphics
cd finegraphics

# Download the dependencies
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Create build folder and run cmake
mkdir build
cd build

# You can add -G "Unix Makefiles" right after .. if you wish
cmake ..  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/... -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel

# Build
make all

# Optionally run the INSTALL step
sudo make install
```

### Windows

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matusnovak/finegraphics
cd finegraphics

# Download the dependencies
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Create build folder and run cmake
mkdir build
cd build

# You can replace the "Visual Studio 15 2017" with 
# "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" to compile for 64-bit applications
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/...

# Build using cmake (or open it in Visual Studio IDE)
cmake --build . --target BUILD_ALL --config MinSizeRel

# Optionally run the INSTALL
sudo cmake --build . --target INSTALL --config MinSizeRel
```

## Using FineGraphics

### Windows

First, compile the library (see section above), next to use the finegraphics in your project, simply include the `C:/path/to/finegraphics/include` and link the `finegraphics.lib`. You will also need the `finegraphics.dll` in order to run the application. Simply copy the DLL into the executable folder. You can find the `.lib` and `.dll` files in the cmake build folder.

### Linux/OSX

First, compile the library (see section above), next to use the finegraphics in your project, simply include the `~/finegraphics/include` (or `/usr/local/include` if you have installed it) and link the `finegraphics.so`. You can find the `.so` files in the cmake build folder (or at the installed path provided by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX).

If you are planning to distribute your application with FineGraphics, you will need to copy the `finegraphics.so` and include it within your application. For example, the most simple way, copy it into the executable folder (same as in Windows).

## Documentation

## Examples

All examples are located in the [examples folder](examples/README.md).

## Alternatives

Looking for alternative library or framework? Try OpenFrameworks, SFML, or Cinder (be warned, they are much more bigger, but feature rich).
